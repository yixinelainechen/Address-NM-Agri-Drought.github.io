        <h4>As the monsoon dynamics in the Southwest shift and the groundwater level continues to decline in the High Plains, there is an imperative need to innovate our approach to address the increasing agricultural drought risk in the region. The proposed project integrates economics and hydrology research related to groundwater, climate, soil, and policy to identify new policy tools and management solutions for addressing agricultural drought in the NM High Plains. The proposed research innovates the previous approaches that focus on a particular aspect of agricultural drought. Within a multidisciplinary framework, the project organizes research activities under three collaborative objectives. <br>
            (1) Understand the soil properties and moisture dynamics under different scenarios (e.g., soil types, cropping practices, irrigation technologies, monsoon dynamics, soil management strategies), and focus on interaction effects of aquifer pumping optimization on soil properties. <br>
            (2) Develop an economic optimization framework to inform conservation of surface and groundwater and aquifer sustainability management. The proposed hydro-economic modeling can help discover relevant water policies for sustaining aquifers and building drought-resistant communities. <br>
            (3) Explore the role of different adaptation strategies under future environmental and technology conditions (e.g., seeds and irrigation). <br>
            (4) Finally, the project will integrate different objectives using system modeling to identify the best policies and adaptation strategies to inform stakeholders about agricultural drought risk management. <br> <br>

            The context of this project is the New Mexico High Plains. The project integrates methods from three cross-disciplinary areas:<br>
            (1) Field experiments and lab analyses to investigate the interaction of groundwater irrigation and soil properties and the potential mechanisms that lead to drought resilience in crop agricultural production; <br> 
            (2) optimization-based hydro-economic modeling to explore the best conservation policy & practices under different scenarios of groundwater management and aquifer sustainability; <br>
            (3) assess different climate adaptation strategies for crop agriculture in the High Plains combining empirical econometrics/spatial analysis and system modeling approach (e.g., integrated social-ecological system modeling and computable general equilibrium modeling).

            Outcomes related to the project are listed below. <br>
            (1) Soil moisture and water potential sensors have been installed at four different locations on active farms in Roosevelt County, NM. Field data collection has commenced, which will be essential for the final integrative modeling. Associated field soil samples have been collected and lab facilities have been set up to process the samples. This part of the work has been led by co-PI Rinehart and PI Wang. <br>
            (2) The first complete version of the hydro-economic model based on NM Ogallala counties (Union, Quay, Curry, Roosevelt, Lea) has been developed. This economic optimization model evaluates different policy and management scenarios to explore strategies for groundwater management and aquifer sustainability. The results and model technical details have been published in Science of the Total Environment. This work can help inform policy debates over a range of water shortage-sharing plans. This part of the work has been led by co-PI Ward. <br>
            (3) Different adaptation options to help address challenges due to groundwater decline have been explored, including weather modification, agrivoltaics, and stackable carbon credits for dryland farming and transitioning from irrigated crops to rangelands. We have also explored the role of community-level social capital in designing and implementing these adaptation strategies. Preliminary analysis of this work has been published through a book chapter and a manuscript under review. This part of the work has been led by PI Wang. <br>
