    <div class="container-box">
        
        <h4>As the monsoon dynamics in the Southwest shift and the groundwater level continues to decline in the High Plains, there is an imperative need to innovate our approach to address the increasing agricultural drought risk in the region. The proposed project integrates economics and hydrology research related to groundwater, climate, soil, and policy to identify new policy tools and management solutions for addressing agricultural drought in the NM High Plains. The proposed research innovates the previous approaches that focus on a particular aspect of agricultural drought. Within a multidisciplinary framework, the project organizes research activities under three collaborative objectives. <br>
            (1) Understand the soil properties and moisture dynamics under different scenarios (e.g., soil types, cropping practices, irrigation technologies, monsoon dynamics, soil management strategies), and focus on interaction effects of aquifer pumping optimization on soil properties. <br>
            (2) Develop an economic optimization framework to inform conservation of surface and groundwater and aquifer sustainability management. The proposed hydro-economic modeling can help discover relevant water policies for sustaining aquifers and building drought-resistant communities. <br>
            (3) Explore the role of different adaptation strategies under future environmental and technology conditions (e.g., seeds and irrigation). <br>
            Finally, the project will integrate different objectives using system modeling to identify the best policies and adaptation strategies to inform stakeholders about agricultural drought risk management. <br> <br>

            (a) presenting project findings at professional conferences and seminars to gather feedback and refine; <br>
            (b) constantly communicating with local agricultural extension specialists and other local stakeholders (e.g. operators) to calibrate model parameters and validate results; <br>
            (c) regularlyconsulting with local government agencies (e.g., NMDA, USDA NRCS service centers) to adjust our modeling efforts to coordinate with local agricultural development initiativesand evaluate the potential economic impacts of our proposed policy solutions.
